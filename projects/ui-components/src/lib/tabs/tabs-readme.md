# Tabs Component

The tabs component is created to be a more style-able and extensible, version of the Angular Material [Tabs](https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/overview).

We are supporting a custom Tabs implementation due to difficulty styling the Material Tabs component.

This component adheres to the [Tabs with manual activation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/examples/tabs-manual/) accessibility pattern. Note that it is currently only accessible when tabs are in a horizontal orientation.
