## ui-components

This library serves as the home for replacements to any Material components that are exceptionally difficult to style, and for reusable components that do not exist in angular Material (e.g., loading dialog).

It provides a centralized location for managing custom components that enhance the functionality and appearance of the application, ensuring consistency and reusability.
