# Chart Multiples

Viz Components provides an optional `multiples` data dimension on each Primary Marks component that
allows you to create multiple charts with the same x and y domains, but different data. This is
useful for creating small multiples, where each chart represents a different subset of the data,
such as a different category or time period.
