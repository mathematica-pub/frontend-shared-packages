# Library versioning

#### Strategy

These are loose guidelines for versioning that we treat as a work in progress and are subject to revision.

We will be using major / minor / path versioning `1.2.3` versioning however we are slightly deviating from industry-standard practices.

## Major Verison (**1**.2.3)

Core maintainers will assess when changes feel large enough to warrant a major version change. Major version changes are expected to not be backwards compatible.

## Minor Version (1.**2**.3)

Minor versions represent relatively small updates, additions or changes to the library. These changes may not be backwards compatible but we expect that that will be at the scale of a property name or two changing.

## Patch Version (1.2.**3**)

Every merge into main that modifies the library code will result in a new patch version if it does not constitute a major or minor version.
